# Windows Domain Controller setup with Active Directory

## Objective

Setting up a Windows Active Directory (AD) is essential for managing and organizing a network of computers and users within a centralized system. Its primary objective is to provide a streamlined and secure method for controlling access to resources, such as files, printers, and applications, while ensuring that policies and permissions are consistently applied across the entire organization. By implementing Active Directory, IT administrators can simplify user authentication and authorization processes, enforce security policies, and reduce administrative overhead. AD also enables the delegation of administrative tasks, facilitating scalability and better management of network resources. Additionally, it enhances security by allowing granular control over who has access to sensitive information and applications, making it a critical component for any enterprise's IT infrastructure.

### Skills Learned

User and Group Management - Creating, managing, and organizing user accounts and groups within Active Directory for secure and efficient access control.
Group Policy Administration - Configuring and managing Group Policies to enforce security settings, software installations, and other network-wide configurations.
DNS and DHCP Integration - Understanding and managing the integration of Active Directory with DNS (Domain Name System) and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) for seamless network functionality.
Active Directory Replication - Managing and troubleshooting AD replication to ensure data consistency and availability across multiple domain controllers.
Security and Access Control - Implementing security best practices through role-based access controls, managing permissions, and auditing to ensure a secure network environment.
